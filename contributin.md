Everyone is welcome to contribute and help to tackle existing issues. To do so, there are a few things you need to know about the code: The Facebook Messenger Bot example is aimed at people that are new to programming, and as such should focus on being very explicit and using non-clever code. Keep the Zen of Python in mind.

Keep a list of enhancements and bugs in the issue tracker. For proposing new features, please start a discussion in the issue tracker, preferably with a real-world example showing the advantage of what you are proposing. Please explain why a feature or change is useful and how it will impact the codebase and the community. Finally, remember all interactions in our official spaces follow our Code of Conduct.

Use parinfer and follow the Clojure Style Guide.

The above contribution guidelines are inspired by the Elixir contributing guidelines.
